# Movie App
Hello! I made this movie app to get more practice with React. The original project that I used as a guide can be found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9eMGE7QtTk (thanks JSM!). Working version can be found on my portfolio https://derekprieur.dev/. Below is a list of most of the concepts used:
## React
- API URLs
- useState()
- async & await
- fetch & .json()
- useEffect(()=>{}, [])
- JSX
- props
- ternaries
- e.target
